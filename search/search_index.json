IBM has made it simple by aligning the common use cases around 4 key areas that we see within our pilots and client activations.</p> <ul> <li>Pattern 1: Securely tune, deploy and manage foundation models. When it comes to task-specific use cases, it is a good idea to work with large open-source models in your own workspace that are under your control. Hugging Face is a large repository with over 950K pre-trained ML models and a platform where the AI ecosystem collaborates on models, datasets and applications. Download any model from Hugging Face and securely deploy at scale on IBM Power. Then, use best-of-breed software to help you tune, deploy and manage as many models as you need. Some examples of what enterprises can use this capability for: Customer service, knowledge workers to augment staff and fraud reporting. \u00a0</li> <li>Pattern 2: There are many new and existing business apps that are using foundation models integrated into the workflows. Deploy your foundation models anywhere, on Power, x86, cloud, and use the watsonx.ai software development kit (SDK) available in Python and embed directly into applications. On Power, enterprises can do this quickly so that services can be released to customers faster on a resilient 24/7 environment. Some examples of clients can embed AI into apps are generating the first draft of reports, citizen services for government end-clients and knowledge management. \u00a0</li> <li>Pattern 3: The ecosystem is important to enterprises that have long-standing investments in software that drives their core business workflows. Consume watsonx services from customers customized ecosystem apps. Enterprises can generate code for Ansible playbooks for IBM i or AIX to enhance the Ansible IT management experience. Additionally, SAP applications can be embedded with watsonx services within the SAP ABAP environments. These custom apps help clients deliver services much faster while taking advantage of existing and familiar investments, making this an attractive proposition for many. Some example use cases include asset management, code generation, accounting automation.  \u00a0</li> <li>Pattern 4: Lastly, we are bringing a full suite of AI capabilities to the Power platform to help clients train, tune and deploy models without purchasing GPUs. The lead time for GPUs is somewhere around a year and clients will miss out on opportunity if they can\u2019t get started today. Some of the popular use cases that enterprises will use are fraud detection, risk underwriting, and demand forecasting.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"Lab1/lab1-overview/#choosing-a-foundation-model","title":"Choosing a foundation model","text":"<p>There are many factors to consider when you choose a foundation model to use for inferencing from a generative AI project.

This helps provide the model with factual and up-to-date information that it may not have learned during training.</li> <li>Augmented Generation: Once the relevant documents are retrieved, the model then generates a response based on the query and the retrieved documents.

They can only generate text based on the data they were trained on, which means they might miss important or up-to-date knowledge.</li> <li>RAG dynamically retrieves information: By incorporating a retrieval step, RAG can pull in relevant, up-to-date documents from external sources to complement the model's output, making it more accurate and current.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Reducing Hallucinations<ul> <li>LLMs sometimes \"hallucinate\": LLMs can generate convincing but incorrect or fabricated answers because they are predicting text based on patterns rather than verifying facts.</li> <li>RAG grounds responses in real data: Since RAG retrieves factual documents before generating a response, it ensures that the output is based on real, verifiable information, reducing the risk of false or misleading content.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scalability in Knowledge<ul> <li>LLMs are limited by training data: Even the largest models have limitations on how much they can remember from their training data, which might become outdated or incomplete.</li> <li>RAG scales with external data: By leveraging vast external knowledge bases or documents, RAG allows for almost unlimited knowledge expansion without retraining the model. This is particularly useful for enterprises or specific domains where continuous data updates are essential.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Improved Performance in Specific Domains<ul> <li>Specialized knowledge is often needed: Many applications require access to niche or domain-specific information, such as legal texts, scientific papers, or proprietary company data.</li> <li>RAG retrieves domain-specific documents: The retrieval step allows RAG to pull in domain-specific or proprietary documents, making the output more relevant for specialized tasks.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Efficiency and Adaptability<ul> <li>Model retraining is costly: Constantly retraining LLMs with new data is computationally expensive and time-consuming.</li> <li>RAG avoids retraining: By using real-time retrieval, RAG can access the latest information or new content without the need to retrain the entire model, making it more adaptable and cost-efficient.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Better Results for Open-Domain Question Answering<ul> <li>Complex queries require precise answers: In tasks like open-domain question answering, general models might struggle to provide precise answers for complex or rare questions.</li> <li>RAG enhances accuracy: By combining retrieval with generation, RAG can provide more accurate, context-rich answers, drawing from a wide range of documents.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p>In summary, RAG addresses limitations in current LLMs by improving factual accuracy, scalability, and adaptability, making it particularly useful for knowledge-intensive tasks and dynamic environments.</p>"},{"location":"Lab2/lab2-overview/#common-usecases-of-rag","title":"Common usecases of RAG","text":"<p>Below are some of the common usecases for RAG:</p> <ol> <li>Open-domain question answering: Where models need to answer questions about a wide range of topics, potentially beyond the training data.</li> <li>Customer support: Providing accurate answers by retrieving relevant documents from knowledge bases.</li> <li>Enterprise AI: Helping businesses with information retrieval, knowledge management, and research by retrieving and summarizing relevant documents.</li> </ol> <p>To summarize, RAG allows models to perform better in knowledge-intensive tasks by combining the strengths of both retrieval systems and generative language models.</p>"},{"location":"Lab2/lab2-overview/#ibm-power-and-rag","title":"IBM Power and RAG","text":""},{"location":"Lab2/lab2-overview/#ibm-power-systems-as-systems-of-record","title":"IBM Power Systems as Systems of Record","text":"<p>IBM Power Systems are renowned for their performance, reliability, and scalability, making them ideal for handling systems of record.
