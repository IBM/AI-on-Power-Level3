# Deploy a Large Language Model (LLM) on IBM Power10

In this lab, we will deploy 2 LLMs from [Hugging Face (HF)](https://huggingface.co/) on IBM Power10 using the on-prem lab environment that has been provisioned.
Goal of this lab is to showcase the basics (and the ease) of deploying a LLM on Power and how easy it is to switch to a different LLM.

!!! note "What is Hugging Face?"

    Hugging Face is an AI company that has become a major hub for Natural Language Processing (NLP) and Machine Learning (ML) tools. It is widely known for its open-source library, Transformers, and its collaborative platform, which provides a vast collection of pre-trained models and datasets. Hugging Face has made it easy for developers, researchers, and businesses to access, fine-tune, and deploy state-of-the-art machine learning models, especially those related to NLP tasks like text classification, translation, summarization, and more.

We use HF to access LLMs in this lab as it has a vast collection of pre-trained models which are hosted publicly and can be accessed for free.

Enterprise clients of IBM will use the [IBM watsonx platform](https://www.ibm.com/watsonx), an enterprise-ready AI and data platform that is designed with the three critical elements of an AI strategy in mind. 
It empowers enterprises to train, tune, and deploy AI across the business, leveraging critical, trusted data wherever it resides.

!!! note "What is IBM watsonx?"

    IBM Watsonx is IBMâ€™s next-generation AI and data platform, designed to help enterprises build, train, fine-tune, and deploy large-scale AI models efficiently. Watsonx enables businesses to harness the power of artificial intelligence and machine learning (AI/ML) for various tasks like generative AI, predictive analytics, and decision-making. It integrates advanced capabilities for handling large language models (LLMs), machine learning workflows, and AI governance.
